## A 3D Shoot\-em\-up using heat seeking missles\.

### Description

Have fun flying around in 3D whilst shooting heat-seeking rockets at a UFO. Pure VB; no DirectX or OpenGL; I did all the maths myself. This is *** VERSION 8 *** - if you want to understand this code, I suggest you start with version 2 which is available on PlanetSourceCode... just search for "Peter Wilson" under the Visual Basic section.

* The 'heat-seeking' rockets always point at the UFO.

* The 'heat-seeking' rockets only have a short fuel supply, so after the fuel is exhausted they tumble back to Earth.

* This is a quick-and-nasty submission.... there is heaps of unused code in here.

* There's a few extra 3D models in the 'xfiles' folder - it's pretty easy to substitute values.

* There's comments everywhere... I suggest stepping through the application using the F8 key (instead of pressing f5)

* I promise to clean this up, and make a good game out of it... or something. I'm getting to the stage where I need to redesign my data structures a little better to accomodate the particle effects (like smoke, and bullets etc.)
