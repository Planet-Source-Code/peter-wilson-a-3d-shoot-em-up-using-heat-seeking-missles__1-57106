    ' There are several ways to calculate the inverse of a matrix.
    ' This method is based on Cramers Rule. I don't fully understand it yet, but it is quite popular.
    ' The only downside to this method, is the number of calculations required. There are several easy methods to
    ' calculate the inverse of an independant transform (ie. scale, rotate and translate) which do not require
    ' complex calculations. However, if you don't know how the matrix was created, then you'll have to determine
    ' it's inverse the long, slow way. Sometimes, a "starting matrix" for an object is automatically imported and
    ' if you want to find it's inverse, you'll need to use this function.
    '
    ' Also see:
    '   http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/matrix/functions/inverse/index.htm
    '
    ' Most of the time, you will only use an inverted matrix when you are trying to optomise your 3D code.
    ' If you don't care about optomizing code, then you'll never have to invert a matrix. They are optional.
    '
    ' Most of the time, you will use an inverted matrix to help speed up Back-Face-Cull or lighting calculations.
    ' Slow Way:
    '   Transform 10,000 faces into the Camera coordinate system,
    '   and then test these 10,000 faces against the Virtual Camera
    '   to see if they are backfacing.
    '
    ' Fast Way:
    '   Transform the Camera into the Object's coordinate system (using an inverse matrix),
    '   and then test against 10,000 faces to see if they are backfacing.
    '   This will save you 10,000 calculations.

    ' (This part explains why we read and calculate from Right to Left. There are other methods that work
    '  equally as well from Left to Right, however this application uses Column Vectors and everything is Right to Left.)
    ' ===================================================================================================================
    ' Step/Equation 1) NewObjectPoints1 = ScaleMatrix         *   OriginalObjectPoint
    ' Step/Equation 2) NewObjectPoints2 = RollMatrix          *   NewObjectPoints1
    ' Step/Equation 3) NewObjectPoints3 = PitchMatrix         *   NewObjectPoints2
    ' Step/Equation 4) NewObjectPoints4 = YawMatrix           *   NewObjectPoints3
    ' Step/Equation 5) NewObjectPoints5 = TranslationMatrix   *   NewObjectPoints4
    '                    NewWorldPoints = NewObjectPoints5
    '
    '   A word on substitution
    '   ======================
    '   Substituting Equation 1 into Equation 2 we get...
    '   NewObjectPoints2 = RollMatrix * Scale * OriginalObjectPoint
    '
    '   If we expand this concept to all equations eventually we'll get...
    '   NewWorldPoints = Translation * Yaw * Pitch * Roll * Scale * OldObjectPoints
    '
    '   Ok, here's the bit that might get confusing... Your probably read the above equation from Left to Right,
    '   however you need to read it from Right to Left, because we are starting with our OldObjectPoints and then
    '   applying a series of transforms to get it into the NewWorldPoints (going from right to left).
    '
    '   For this routine, we won't be touching the OldObjectPoints at all.... we just want the concatenation of all
    '   of the matrices...
    '
    '       WorldMatrix = (Translation * Yaw * Pitch * Roll * Scale)
    '
    '       Remember, this is read from Right to Left (at least in this program), so Scale gets applied first, then Roll,
    '       then pitch and so on. Most 3D programmers get confused about this issue (including me), so it's important NOT
    '       to take guesses (as is common with many people), but to make sure you know exactly why you are applying a
    '       transform and the exact order that is applied with respect to the *whole program*.  If you don't understand
    '       this concept, you'll be forever taking guesses as to how to rotate complex objects, or setup special cameras.
    '
    ' I see a lot of 3D programmers rotate objects, like cubes, space ships, etc.  This is what most 3D programmers
    ' attempt to do in their first programs (including me). This is actually pretty easy to do, and there are several
    ' ways of doing it. However, this can also be a bit of a trap. Setting up a real synthetic camera is not so easy.
    ' Instead of rotating objects, you leave the objects alone and rotate the coordinate system instead. This requires a
    ' leap in logic that may seem hard to follow at first, and I suppose what I'm trying to say is, this is what
    ' separates the men from the boys (sorry girls). However once you fully understand the synthetic camera and all of the
    ' transforms to make it happen, many new possabilites begin to open up! Exciting possabilites!
    '
    ' eg. A real synthetic camera allows you to easily setup "rear vision mirrors", "split screen", or even splitting
    ' a view accross several monitors to achieve a wrap-around effect. Hmmmm.... I might make a network version
    ' of this program so that I can have three monitors in front of me to increase my 3D view of the world!.
    ' You could even program three separate computers to work on the same image on the same monitor - ie. Network rendering.
    ' If you're just fudging your synthetic camera, then the fudging becomes harder (if not impossible), when you try
    ' to do these sorts of exotic transforms, but this stuff is easy (well.. much easier) when you do the maths properly.
    '

    ' Comments about "Gimbal Lock"
    ' ============================
    ' At some time during your rotations, you may notice a phenomenon called "Gimbal Lock".
    ' You will notice gimbal lock when your object won't rotate how you think it should.
    '
    ' For example...
    ' If your aeroplane is flying straight and level, then banking and yawing the plane works normally.
    ' However, if you Pitch your plane down into a 90 deg nose dive, then banking and yawing seem to do
    ' *exactly* the same thing!  You will have *lost* the ability to rotate your airplane on one
    ' of it's axis; This is the gimbal lock phenomenon. This also occurs in first-person shoot-em-up games
    ' where you use the mouse to look around; when you look straight up, you almost always get gimbal lock.

    ' and movement in a single matrix. If you are using a 3x3 matrix then you can't do this and
    ' will have to calculate rotation and movement as separate steps. A 3x3 matrix also makes it
    ' harder to rotate an object around a point that is not it's origin. Heck! There's a lot of
    ' agruments about 3x3 vs. 4x4, and I can't be bothered getting into them. Just do it the correct
