Overview.
=========
Have fun flying around in 3D whilst shooting heat-seeking rockets at a UFO. Pure VB; no DirectX or OpenGL; I did all the maths myself. Yee Harrrr!

This is *** VERSION 8 *** - if you want to understand this code a bit better, I suggest you start with version 2.0 which is available on PlanetSourceCode... just search for "Peter Wilson" under the Visual Basic section.



Controls.
=========
* Standard Quake-style 3D controls.
* Use the mouse to look around - mouse button is fire.
* Use the W, A, S, D keys to move.
* Use Shift and Ctlr to move faster and slower.
* Space bar moves up.
* ESC key to quit.



Noteable features.
==================
* The 'heat-seeking' rockets always point at the UFO.
* The 'heat-seeking' rockets only have a short fuel supply, so after the fuel is exhausted they tumble back to Earth.
* This is a quick-and-nasty submission.... there is heaps of unused code in here.
* There's a few extra 3D models in the 'xfiles' folder - it's pretty easy to substitute values.
* There's comments everywhere... I suggest stepping through the application using the F8 key (instead of pressing f5)
* I promise to clean this up, and make a good game out of it... or something. I'm getting to the stage where I need to redesign my data structures a little better to accomodate the particle effects (like smoke, and bullets etc.)
