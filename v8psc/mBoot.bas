' Variable Prefixes used in this program
' ======================================
'   g_      =   global variable. ie. this variable is available anywhere within the program.
'   m_      =   module-level variable
'   p_      =   parameters that appear in function/sub declarations. ie. Private Sub DoWork(p_strWithData As String)
'   bln     =   Boolean Data Type. True or False
'   int     =   Integer Data Type. -32,768 to 32,767
'   lng     =   Long Data Type. (Long integer) -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
'   sng     =   Single Data Type. (single-precision floating-point) -3.402823E38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values; 1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E38 for positive values
'   dbl     =   Double Data Type. (double-precision floating-point) -1.79769313486232E308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values; 4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E308 for positive values

'   obj     =   Generic Object; either an unknown type of Object, or a known Object type.
'   cls     =   Class Object.
'   frm     =   Form Object.
'   var     =   Variant Data Type.
'   Example:
'       g_clsApplication        =   Global Class named Application
'       g_curFramePerfCount     =   Global Currency Data Type called FramePerfCount
'       m_frm3DLibrary          =   Module Level variable, which holds a Form object called 3DLibrary.


' How to Open and Close this application.
' =======================================
' This mBoot module creates the main Application Class (g_clsApplication).
' From now on - the Application class calls the shots and is basically in charge.
' You are probably used to just Loading a Form, or even an MDI form.  Well... this
' is a little bit different. The Application class (g_clsApplication) is now in
' charge of the form 'frmCanvas'. You don't have to code this way, it's just my personal preference.
Public g_clsApplication As Peters3DEngine8.Application


' Used in Form_QueryUnload events

' Change the value of 'g_blnCompiledDebugInfo' in the Project Properties area, NOT in the code.
#If g_blnCompiledDebugInfo = True Then

    ' =============================================================
    ' Start Application Logging (to a file)

    ' Note: If the g_clsApplication class didn't open a form, then this VB program
    '       would end right here!  This VB program will end automatically when
    '       the g_clsApplication class closes all of the forms that it has opened.

    '       In VB.NET it's not enough to show a form (within the application class), you must
